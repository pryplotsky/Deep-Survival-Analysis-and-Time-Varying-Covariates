# Deep Survival Analysis and Time-Varying Covariates
This project explores the use of Dynamic DeepHit, a novel machine learning model, for handling time-varying covariates in the context of credit risk. Its performance is compared with the time-varying Cox regression model using a large dataset of 50,000 U.S. mortgage borrowers. The analysis provides strong evidence supporting both models, with Dynamic DeepHit consistently outperforming the Cox model.

To further investigate the role of time-varying covariates, we conduct an exercise in which these covariates are averaged over time. Surprisingly, this simplification shows minimal impact on the predictive performance of Dynamic DeepHit â€” except for one key variable: the house price index. Replacing this covariate with a time-invariant version leads to a notable drop in performance, highlighting its unique influence on credit risk predictions.
