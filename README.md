# Deep Survival Analysis and Time-Varying Covariates
The article examines the potential of Dynamic DeepHit - a novel machine learning model – to handle Time-Varying Covariates in the credit risk context and compare its performance with Time-Varying Cox regression. Performing analysis on a large dataset of 50,000 US mortgage borrowers provides strong evidence in favour of both the models, where Dynamic DeepHit outperforms Time-Varying Cox model. We also perform an exercise to gauge the importance of variance in time-varying covariates by taking their averages across time, which, to our surprise, goes to show that time-variance did not matter too much for risk predictions made by Dynamic DeepHit, with the exception of one time-varying covariate – house price index – whose invariance yields worse results when compared to other time-varying features.
